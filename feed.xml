      <title>Echo Canyon Road Trail Guide </title>
      <link>https://4x4trailrunners.com/6906-2/</link>
      <description>An easy rock road accessing the Inyo Mine from Hwy 190 in Death Valley National Park. The Backcountry and Wilderness Access Map describes the trail as high clearance for the first three miles and 4x4 required beyond. In April 2023, this road was flat and smooth and did not require either along the mellow but constant 3,500' climb up to the mine. This canyon was flooded and closed after storms in August 2022, but the washouts may have evened out the trail. Notable features include small rock arches above the canyon walls, including the Eye of the Needle. Dispersed camping is allowed along this road, but as of Winter 2023, free backcountry camping permits are required.</description>

      <description>Echo Canyon Road Trail Guide

An easy rock road accessing the Inyo Mine from Hwy 190 in Death Valley National Park. The Death Valley Backcountry and Wilderness Access Map describes Echo Canyon as high clearance the first three miles and 4x4 required beyond. In April 2023, this road was flat and smooth and did not require either along the mellow but constant 3,500' climb up to the mine. This canyon was flooded (and subsequently closed) after heavy storms in August 2022, so perhaps the storms evened out the trail. In addition to the Inyo Mine, additional features along this trail are small rock arches in the canyon walls above. The most notable is the Eye of the Needle Arch. Dispersed camping is allowed along Echo Canyon Road but as of Winter 2023, free backcountry camping permits are now required.</description>
